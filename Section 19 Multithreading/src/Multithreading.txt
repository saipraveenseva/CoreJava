Multiprogramming is running more than one program in a single machine.

Multiprogramming can be divide into 2 ways.
Mutli-user programming multiple users be using same resource simultaneously.
Multitasking is where a single user runs more than one simultaneous programs at the same time.
Multitasking can be further deduced into Multi threading

States of a thread
------------------
new state(use start method)
ready state(run method will execute)
running state --> wait state
running state --> timed wait state(exits when times up)
running state --> blocked state
running state --> terminate state

Thread priorities
-----------------
In multi threading a scheduler places all the threads to be executed in a Ready queue.
So these threads are given chance as per the algorithm used. Lets say we are using Round robin.
Each thread is given a certain amount of time of CPU and it is placed back at the end of ready queue and the one in the front is given a chance.

Apart from this we can assign some priorities to each thread so that they can execute as per the priorities.
JVM has its own scheduler
