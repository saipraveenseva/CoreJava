Generalisation
--------------
iPhone, Samsung and Vivo are devices, we can generalise them into a category called smartphones
Bottom up approach

In Java if we have some classes lets say iPhone, Samsung and Vivo, we can group them and write one super class from them
and refer all the subclasses using the name of super calls. This is called Generalisation
This is achieved using Interfaces.l

Specialisation
--------------
Circle is an entity we add some property called height to it, and it becomes a cylinder.
Innova is a car they added extra features and made a fortuner.
Top-down approach

In Java lets say we have a super class called Circle, we inherit the properties of Circle and
add a new property height and write a cylinder class.
This is achieved using Inheritance.


Inheritance is acquiring the properties from an existing class to a new class.
Circle --> Cylinder
Rectangle -->Cuboid
